### 🧬 Sequence Analysis (`sequence_analysis`)

This section is dedicated to statistical analysis and comparison of genetic data. The solutions here demonstrate an understanding of the biological significance of mutations and methods for identifying common regulatory elements.

##### 📊 Solved Tasks:

1. HAMM (Counting Point Mutations)

> What it does: Calculates the Hamming distance (number of differences) between two strings of equal length.
> Purpose: Estimating evolutionary distance and the intensity of point mutations.

2. GC (Computing GC Content)

> What it does: Identifies the sequence ID with the highest Guanine and Cytosine content.
> Purpose: GC content directly affects the DNA melting temperature and genome stability.

3. CONS (Consensus and Profile)

> What it does: Constructs a profile matrix and generates a consensus string for a set of DNA sequences.
> Purpose: Used for creating gene "logos" and searching for common motifs in promoter regions.
