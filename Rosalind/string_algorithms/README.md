### 🧬 String Algorithms (`string_algorithms`)

This section contains solutions demonstrating skills in efficient processing of textual bioinformatics information. Emphasis is placed on memory management, algorithmic speed, and understanding biological data structures.

##### 🛠 Solved Tasks:

1. Motif and Pattern Searching
SUBS (Finding a Motif in DNA)

> What it does: Finds all starting positions of a given substring within a sequence.
> Features: Two implementation variants (basic `str.find` and regular expressions).

2. Comparative Sequence Analysis
LCSM (Finding a Shared Motif)

> What it does: Identifies the longest common substring for a dataset in FASTA format.

3. String Transformation
REVC (Complementing a Strand of DNA)

> What it does: Generates the reverse complement of a DNA strand.
> Core: Implementation of the basic reversal and nucleotide substitution algorithm (A-T, C-G) without using heavy libraries, to understand the fundamentals of working with antiparallel strands.

4. ORF Finder
(ORF) Open Reading Frames

> This script identifies all potential protein strings derived from Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence, covering all six reading frames.
