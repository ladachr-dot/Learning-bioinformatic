#### 🕸 Graph Theory in Bioinformatics (`graph_theory`)

> Mathematical foundation of modern genome assembly. This section includes tasks focused on sequence reconstruction through graph structures.

##### 📋 Solved Tasks:

1. **GRPH (Overlap Graphs)**
    * **Core:** Constructing an adjacency list for an $O_3$ overlap graph.
    * **Purpose:** This is a simplified model of how de novo assembly algorithms stitch short reads into complete chromosomes based on their overlaps.
