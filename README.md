# Learning Bioinformatics

### 📌 About me

I am a first-year Biotechnology student (specializing in Biopharmaceutics) at ITMO University. I use this repository to practice programming skills on real biological data.

* Since the beginning of 2026, I have been actively solving Rosalind problems to learn how to apply Python in practice. Completed so far:
* The entire **Python Village** (not included in the repository as it's introductory).
* Part of the **Bioinformatics Stronghold** track.

* **Since February 2026**, I have been doing an internship as part of my university practice at the **AI in Chemistry Center**.

Currently, this repository contains all the tasks and projects that, in my opinion, best demonstrate my acquired skills.

**Progress for February 2026:** ~25 Rosalind problems solved and 1 Kaggle project.

**Total solved:**

* The entire **Python Village** (not included in the repository as it's introductory).
* Part of the **Bioinformatics Stronghold** track.
